## Personal Project Idea

### Idea Description
I want to create a simple app that helps users choose recipes to make without the hassle of having to try to find something. I want it to start by choosing a region or type or cuisine and then narrow down the possible choices from there. The goal is to make it easier to choose something to cook. 

### Possible Features
Have an easy navigation menu where users start with broad possibilities that get narrowed down the further in they go. 

### List of Screens
1. Home page
   --> Present options for appetizers, entrees, desserts, or drinks
2. Types of food by region 
   --> This page would have options with large international regions or popular types of cuisine to choose from
3. List of popular recipes
   --> This page would have a list of the most popular recipes based on the region chosen at the start
